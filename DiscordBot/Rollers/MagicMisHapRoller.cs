        { 4, "The flesh of your mouth and jaw rots away revealing the white bones beneath. Better wear a mask from now on." },

        { 11, "Nature tries to reclaim you. d8 vines spring from the earth and begin dragging you down. Succeed DR12 Strength or be buried alive." },

        { 13, "Reality tears. A rift in space opens and terrible creatures spill out and attack everything in sight." },

        { 17, "Black as the night. Your eyes go black and anyone who looks at them is filled with a chilling dread. If you suspect the townsfolk or inquisitors are on to you, they are now." },
        { 18, "Mist and moonbeams. You turn into a vapour and cannot move or interact with the world for d4 rounds." },
        { 19, "A hunter's mark you alone can see. A symbol burns above your head. In d4 days, a Shadow Hunter will find you and try to slay you." },
        { 20, "A bell tolls. At a time of rest, you will be approached by a charming and mysterious figure. They will challenge you to a game of chance; if you win you get a free DL. Lose and they will snatch you away." }
